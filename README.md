# This-band-changed-my-life
"This band changed my life" is a  fan blog of your favourite band. Here you can submit some memories there is attached with a music of the band you choose. This project was to practice my learnings about Node, Express and EJS. 

If you click the Login button, you will see an example one of my favourite band.

This was a project proposed by the Capstone project 3 from:

  The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp - by Angela Yu

Some enhancements that i want to do later (now i have to keep tracking my studies and abilities):
- Make the login functional;
- Make headers buttons on portable media;
- More than one Band for login;
- Catch an video of the music from youtube API and the ( image of the album - DONE );
- Set a date of posts (not that hard, but i really need to keep running on the course);
- Change the links from "footer" to icons (same case as earlier);
- Set an options button that the user can manipulate the content, style and details of his blog;
- Can you sugest me? I'd love a chalenge!
